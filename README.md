# SEACCOW

Security Evaluation and Assurance Covert Channel Online Warden

This is the code repository for the SEACCOW Covert Channel Detection system.
The main project file (`seaccow.qpf`) can be compiled and loaded onto an FPGA
using Intel's Quartus II software. The software project file (`seaccow.amp`)
can then be built and loaded onto the processor using the Altera Monitor
Program. Also included here are various SystemVerilog test benches that can be
used to test the system with Icarus Verilog.
